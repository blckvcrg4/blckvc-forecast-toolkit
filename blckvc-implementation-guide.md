## Step 4: Building the Cost Model Tab

The Cost-Model tab breaks down expenses by type and timing.

1. **Create Column Headers:**

   - Total_Expenses: `=Cost_Model!C23` (linked to Cost-Model total)
   - Net_Income: `=C3-C4`
   - Beginning_Cash: `=IF(C2=3, Drivers!C78, E6)` (use initial balance in first month, previous month's ending balance thereafter)
   - Net_Burn: `=IF(C5<0, C5, 0)` (only record negative months)
   - Cash_Balance: `=C6+C5` (beginning cash plus net income)
   - Runway_Months: `=IF(C7<0, C8/ABS(C7*-1), 999)` (cash รท burn rate, 999 if profitable)

3. **Set Up Performance Metrics:**
   - Contribution_Margin_%: `=(C3-Cost_Model!C24)/C3*100` (revenue minus variable costs, divided by revenue)
   - Burn_Multiple: `=IF(C7<0, ABS(C7)/C3, 0)` (burn รท revenue, 0 if profitable)

## Step 6: Building the Case-Switch Tab

The Case-Switch tab allows toggling between scenarios.

   - Cell B1: "Optimistic"
   - Cell C1: "Base"
   - Cell D1: "Conservative"
   - Cell E1: "Current"
   - Cell F1: "Notes"

2. **Add Key Scenario Drivers:**
   - BVI_Seats_Forecast: 40 / 32 / 24
   - Sponsor_Close_%: 70% / 50% / 30%
   - Gala_Tickets_Forecast: 400 / 275 / 150
   - Event_COGS_%: 45% / 50% / 55%
   - Pledge_Probability: 80% / 60% / 40%
   - Foundation_Probability: 60% / 40% / 20%

3. **Create Toggle Formula:**
   ```
   =IF(Drivers!C103=1, B3, IF(Drivers!C103=2, C3, D3))
   ```
   This formula returns the value from the appropriate scenario column based on the toggle setting in the Drivers tab.

4. **Add Trigger Outcome Row:**
   - Optimistic: "No Pivot"
   - Base: "Evaluate Pivot"
   - Conservative: "Initiate Pivot"

## Step 7: Setting Up the Targets Tab

The Targets tab establishes goals and minimum thresholds.

1. **Create Column Headers:**
   - Cell A1: "Metric"
   - Cell B1: "Target"
   - Cells C1-K1: "Apr-25" through "Dec-25"
   - Cell L1: "Notes"

2. **Add Target Metrics:**
   - Revenue_Target: Monthly goals ($75k for most months, $275k for June, $175k for September)
   - Runway_Minimum: 9 months for all periods
   - Burn_Multiple_Cap: 2 for all periods
   - Cash_Balance_Minimum: Starting at $1.5M, decreasing by $50k per month
   - Required_Growth: `=C3-Rev_Model!C23` (gap between target and current revenue)

3. **Add Program-Specific Targets:**
   - Sponsor_Close_%_Target: 50%
   - BVI_Gross_Margin_Target: 35%
   - SoBV_Gala_Break_Even: 40% (ticket percentage needed for break-even)

## Step 8: Creating the Dashboard Tab

The Dashboard tab visualizes key metrics using charts and conditional formatting.

1. **Create KPI Section:**
   - Current Cash Balance (with conditional formatting based on minimum threshold)
   - Current Runway (with conditional formatting based on 9-month minimum)
   - YTD Revenue vs. Target (with variance percentage)
   - Burn Multiple (with conditional formatting based on 2x cap)

2. **Create Cash and Runway Chart:**
   - Line chart showing cash balance and runway by month
   - Add horizontal line for minimum runway threshold (9 months)
   - Add horizontal line for minimum cash threshold

3. **Create Revenue Bridge Chart:**
   - Stacked column chart showing revenue contribution by stream
   - Include target revenue line

4. **Create Gap Analysis Chart:**
   - Column chart showing gap between target and actual revenue
   - Use conditional formatting to highlight months with large gaps

5. **Create Contribution Margin Chart:**
   - Bar chart showing contribution margin by program
   - Include target margin line (35%)

6. **Create Pipeline Table:**
   - List top opportunities with potential value, probability, and weighted value
   - Sort by weighted value (highest to lowest)
   - Include action required column

7. **Add Scenario Toggle Control:**
   - Data validation dropdown linked to Drivers tab
   - Include visual indicator of current scenario

## Step 9: Setting Up Conditional Formatting

Apply conditional formatting to highlight important metrics:

1. **Cash Balance Warning:**
   ```
   Format cells if... Cell value is less than...
   =Targets!C7
   ```
   Format: Red background

2. **Runway Warning:**
   ```
   Format cells if... Cell value is less than...
   =9
   ```
   Format: Red background

3. **Burn Multiple Warning:**
   ```
   Format cells if... Cell value is greater than...
   =2
   ```
   Format: Red background

4. **Revenue Gap Warning:**
   ```
   Format cells if... Custom formula is...
   =AND(C10>0, C10>150000)
   ```
   Format: Red background

## Step 10: Monthly Review Process Implementation

Establish a routine for monthly updates:

1. **Pre-Meeting Preparation:**
   - Kareema updates previous month's actuals by the 3rd of each month
   - Team updates all probability weights based on latest pipeline information
   - Dashboard is refreshed with latest data

2. **Monthly Review Meeting Agenda:**
   - Review KPIs against targets
   - Identify revenue gaps and opportunities to close them
   - Review program contribution margins
   - Discuss any trigger points requiring action
   - Assign action items for addressing gaps

3. **Documentation:**
   - Record all assumption changes in a change log
   - Document decisions made based on forecast data
   - Track forecast accuracy over time

## Appendix: Sample Goal Seek Analysis

To determine critical thresholds for financial sustainability, use the Solver add-on in Google Sheets:

Example 1: Minimum BVI Seats Required for Program Profitability
1. Objective: Set Contribution_Margin_% (for September) >= 35%
2. By changing: BVI_Seats_Forecast
3. Subject to constraints: BVI_Seats_Forecast <= 40

Example 2: Minimum Sponsor Close % Needed to Meet Annual Revenue Goal
1. Objective: Set December Cash_Balance >= $1.5M
2. By changing: Sponsor_Close_% (for all corporate and foundation prospects)
3. Subject to constraints: 20% <= Sponsor_Close_% <= 70%

These analyses will help identify the key leverage points in your financial model to focus your team's efforts for maximum impact.
